Students can join the queue and wait for their turn. If they see similar questions get asked, they can follow the question and get notified when it is answered.

## Stress Test

The system has undergone extensive stress testing using Cypress end-to-end tests. These tests simulate multiple students and TAs interacting with the system simultaneously—joining queues, switching between types (marking/questions), being called, and managing rapid updates. The app was able to handle dozens of concurrent users adding, removing, and updating questions in real time, ensuring that all state changes were reflected without data loss or UI glitches.

Example cypress scenarios include:
- Simulating 100+ students joining and leaving the queue in rapid succession
- Handling network disconnects and reconnections gracefully
- Ensuring the queue state stays consistent across all connected clients

These tests give confidence that the queue management logic is robust and performs well even under heavy classroom usage.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Frontend
npm install

# Backend
cd server
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Server

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`

### 3. Start the Frontend

In a new terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage
